# Ultra-X-Wifi-Decompile
A decomplation of the Ultra-X + WiFi app on android

# Why?
I'm doing this because I want to use my drone on more than just my phone, and I can do that with dronelib which I'm modifying to have camera support, but to get camera support either have to decompile the app or find out how to obtain the firmware from the drone itself and hack my way through there.

I don't want to risk breaking my drone, so decompiling it is then!
